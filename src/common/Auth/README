KeyVault Manager

KeyManager expects a config dicctionary with the following parameters:
"TENANT_ID" : "<azure tenant (directory) id to which the client service principal belongs>",
"CLIENT_ID" : "<azure client id of the client service principal, also called application id>",
"THUMBPRINT" : "<thumbprint of the client cert>",
"KV_URI" : "<uri to the key vault holding the secrets>",
# this file must be downloaded from the keyvault manually for local development
# DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO VERSION CONTROL. If you name it <name>.pem .gitignore will ignore it
"PKEY_FILE" : "<private key file>.pem"

use get_secret(secret_name) to get the secret from key vault
